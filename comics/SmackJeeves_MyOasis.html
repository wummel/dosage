<h2>Dosage comic SmackJeeves/MyOasis</h2>

<tr>
<th>Description</th><td>Includes YAOI(m/m,slash,boy love,shonen-ai) Hazu is the only son of Councilman Yuroba and is already set up to marry into another tribe.Bored of staying in the colony he ventures out one day only to come across a small expedition on their way to the mountain which protects their village.One of the young Archeologists,Johnathan,seems to catch Hazu's eye.A sandstorm blows in and everyone,expedition and Hazu,race to find shelter in a cave.At this close proximity Hazu seems to grow more attached to the young human and has the sudden urge to capture his interest in turn.Surza,his proposed,fights against their relationship entirely.Only more problems arise when Hazu chooses to protect him. Johnathan is merely a normal human.He doesn't talk much,he sticks to his books instead of with people,he has a love for everything made by nature,and is, apparently,Hazu's property.The human is abducted while he and his expedition protect themselves from a sandstorm inside a cave.There isn't anything special about him. But to Hazu he is every bit of everything. Updates: Hopefully Mondays AND/OR Thursdays. Do NOT hold me to it though! I'll try my best though!</td>
