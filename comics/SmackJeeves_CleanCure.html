<th>Description</th><td>-A few hundred years into the future, life has changed, but remained relatively the same from a social standpoint. Various government plans to deal with the changing global climate ended in many successes, but many more failures. As a result, certain mutations began to appear in humans as well as animals, and though most were bred out, some remain to the present. -Enter Ezra and Percy; two young men, cat-boys in fact, whom are facing a tough time not only surviving day to day, but making their dreams a reality. After losing their current job, they are offered a new one by a seemingly normal, but secretive man with a lot of money. Their new boss employs them as maids, frilly dresses and all, and makes them clean his and the mansions of others. It quickly becomes apparent that their boss is more interested in the ever mutating rat-like creatures which are making their homes in the dirty world of military cover-ups and powerful family connections. When these two get caught up in the lies and secrecy of their new occupation, will they be able to escape? And what is the connection between mutations and the incident 20 years ago?
