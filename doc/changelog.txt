        Lots of fixes / enhancements, still fairly alpha.

Dosage v.0.2.0:

        comic modules.
    * Junview:

            The comic "bounces" when you get to the first strip, the

            checking for the first comic.
        - SexyLosers
            SexyLosers seems to have implemented referrer checking recently,
            this is handled by the new referrer passing support.
